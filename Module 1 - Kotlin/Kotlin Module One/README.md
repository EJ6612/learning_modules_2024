# easEquations (Kotlin Edition)
This is a Kotlin version of the Windows 11 easEquations app (C#/XAML UWP). I used the basis of the original app to learn the basics of Kotlin and how it works as I converted C# code to Kotlin.

easEquations (Kotlin Edition) only supports 2D Shapes, Quadratic Equation, and 2 3D Objects (Boxes and Spheres). Code is present for Slope Intercept and more 3D Objects, but available to the user.
